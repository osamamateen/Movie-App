# Movie-App
A Movie Library made with Node and Express JS. This was my second project after finishing a Web Developer Bootcamp. It fetches information from an API, and displays it in a nice way. The user can also post reviews about movies which is stored in the database (MongoDb). You can click on Imdb button and the application will direct you to Imdb page of the particular movie, Similarly you can click on download for torrent links to the particular movie and watch now for online streaming link.
